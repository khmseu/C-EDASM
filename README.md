# EDASM (C++/ncurses)

Port of the Apple II EDASM editor/assembler/tools from `markpmlim/EdAsm` to modern C++ targeting Linux with ncurses for screen handling. The goal is to stay close to the original 6502 logic while adapting storage and UI to a terminal environment.

Line# Addr  Bytes        Source
----- ----  ----------   ---------------------------
0001                     ; Simple 6502 program

0005  0802  8D 00 04             STA $0400
0007  0807  CA           LOOP    DEX

LOOP             $0807 RSTART            $0800 R
```

### Expression Examples
```asm
; Arithmetic
LDA #$10+$20        ; Addition: $30
LDA #$20-$10        ; Subtraction: $10
LDA #4*8            ; Multiplication: $20
LDA #16/2           ; Division: 8

; Byte extraction
LDA #<$1234         ; Low byte: $34
LDA #>$1234         ; High byte: $12

; Bitwise (EDASM syntax - NOTE: different from C!)
LDA #$FF^$0F        ; AND (^ in EDASM): $0F
LDA #$F0|$0F        ; OR (| same as C): $FF
LDA #$FF!$AA        ; XOR (! in EDASM): $55
```

## Known Limitations & EDASM Syntax Notes

### Bitwise Operator Syntax
**Important**: EDASM uses non-standard bitwise operator syntax:
- `^` = AND (not XOR like in C)
- `!` = XOR (not logical NOT)
- `|` = OR (same as C)

This matches the original Apple II EDASM behavior for compatibility.

### Feature Status
- **Split buffer mode (SWAP)**: Not implemented (editor enhancement, low priority)
- **BCD line numbers**: Partial implementation (cosmetic feature)
- **Macro support (MACLIB)**: Not implemented (was incomplete in original EDASM)

### Comparison to Original EDASM
- ✅ Command syntax: 100% compatible
- ✅ Assembler directives: 100% compatible
- ✅ 6502 instruction set: Complete
- ✅ Expression evaluation: Complete with EDASM syntax
- ✅ REL file format: Complete
- ✅ Linker: Fully functional
- ⚠️ File system: Uses Linux paths instead of ProDOS
- ⚠️ Screen: ncurses terminal instead of Apple II 40-column

## Implementation Roadmap

1. ✅ **Weeks 1-2**: Core infrastructure (command parser, file I/O) - **COMPLETE**
2. ✅ **Weeks 3-4**: Editor module (text buffer, commands) - **95% COMPLETE**
3. ✅ **Weeks 5-6**: Assembler Pass 1 (tokenizer, symbol table) - **COMPLETE**
4. ✅ **Weeks 7-8**: Assembler Pass 2 (code generation, expressions) - **COMPLETE**

7. **Weeks 13-14**: Testing & polish - **IN PROGRESS**

## Original EDASM Structure

The original Apple II EDASM consists of:

- **EI** (EDASM Interpreter) - Command dispatch, module loading
- **EDITOR** - Text buffer, line editing, file commands
- **ASM** (Assembler) - Two-pass 6502 assembler with symbol table
- **LINKER** - Links relocatable object files
- **COMMONEQUS.S** - Shared constants and definitions

See submodule at `third_party/EdAsm/EDASM.SRC/` for complete 6502 source.

## Contributing

This is a faithful port aiming to preserve EDASM semantics while using modern C++ idioms. Key principles:

- Keep command syntax identical for compatibility
- Preserve directive names and behavior
- Use modern C++ (RAII, smart pointers) while maintaining logical equivalence
- Correctness and maintainability over performance
